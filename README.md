# qt3uw-polarimeter
## Introduction:
This project is designed to measure and analyze the polarization state of a coherant light source entering the system (i.e a laser). Using a combination of hardware control, and data acquisition components, this system allows for calibration and real-time measurements of Polarization.

###   Key Features: 
* __Automated Calibration__: The system can automatically calibrate both the polarizer and quarter wave plate and save their calibration data for future use

* __Polarization Measurement__: Built in algorithms extract parameters from raw data used to compute and visualize the polarization state of incoming light

* __User-Friendly Interface__: This project is accompanied with a simple GUI that allows for easy control of the system include initialization, calibration, data collection, and visualization

 * __Visualization__: The interface provides a plotting feature to visualize the polarization state over time, allowing for multiple plots at once combined with a greyscale feature to denote newer data

This project is ideal for researchers and engineers working in optical expirementation requiring a solution for a polarimeter measurement and calibration of lasers
